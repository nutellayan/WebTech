# 🕵️ Spot the Differences Game

A fun and interactive web-based **Spot the Differences** game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of my Web Technologies coursework. Players compare two images side by side to find visual differences — supported by hints, sound effects, and clean visual feedback.
