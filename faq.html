    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>1. How do I play the game?</h3>
    <p>You will be shown two similar images side-by-side. Click on the areas where you spot a difference. Find all 5 differences to complete the level.</p>

    <h3>2. How many hints do I get?</h3>
    <p>You get 3 hints per level. Clicking the hint button will briefly highlight one difference. Be quick to spot it!</p>

    <h3>3. What happens if I click the wrong spot?</h3>
    <p>There’s no penalty! You’ll just hear an error sound. Keep trying until you find all the differences.</p>

    <h3>4. Is there a time limit?</h3>
    <p>Nope! The game is stress-free with no countdown timer. Take your time to enjoy and explore each image.</p>

    <h3>5. Can I turn off the sound or music?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Use the Sound 🔊 and Music 🎵 buttons in the top navigation to turn them on or off at any time.</p>

    <h3>6. How do I move to the next level?</h3>
    <p>After finding all differences, a message will pop up. Click "OK" and then “Next” to proceed to the next level.</p>

    <h3>7. Will new levels be added?</h3>
    <p>We plan to add more image sets in the future. Stay tuned!</p>

    <h3>8. Do I need to create an account?</h3>
    <p>No account is needed. You can play the game freely without signing up.</p>

    <h3>9. Is there a tutorial or help available?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can read the <a href="how-to-play.html">How To Play</a> section or watch our <a href="demo.html">Demo Video</a> to get a feel for the game.</p>

    <h3>10. Why aren’t my clicks working properly?</h3>
    <p>If you’re clicking the right spot but it doesn’t register, your browser zoom might not be set to <strong>100%</strong>. Because the game image is scaled for layout, incorrect zoom levels can cause misalignment. You can reset zoom by pressing <code>Ctrl + 0</code> (or <code>Cmd + 0</code> on Mac).</p>

    <h3>11. What devices or browsers work best for this game?</h3>
    <p>The game runs best on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge on a desktop or laptop. While it may work on tablets or phones, for the most accurate clicks and full image visibility, we recommend using a computer with a mouse or trackpad.</p>
